**How to use it?**

With the game open and logged in, launch the app and that's it. The counter starts counting :)

This is a terminal app, it is recommended to use the Terminal app to run it. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the Microsoft Store (https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701).

> If you lose the session (you get disconnected due to an internet outage, for example) it will try to continue where it was, but this functionality is not very tested (as I said, it's an alpha).

Secret mode: Run the app before opening the game and it will show you the value of all the coins and resources you have :P

**FAQ:**
Is this app secure for my PC or files?
> Yes, it is. I don't want to steal your My Little Pony account, don't worry. You can always read the code and audit it, it's simple.

What programming language is it programmed in?
> C

Is the source code open source?
> Yes, it is. You can find it in my GitHub here: [Tib2Farmer](https://github.com/will0w7/tib2farmer)

Why doesn't the app have an icon? Is this correct?
> I had made an icon for the app and put it there, but it made it weigh more than twice as much and I took it away.

How do I know if it works on my PC?
> It only works in **Windows**. Tested by me in all latest Windows 11 versions, and tested in Windows 10 too. But just try it :)

**Keep in mind 4 things:**
1. It's an alpha, it's not finished and it doesn't intend to be for a while.
2. After a patch to the game it's possible that the app will also need a patch.
3. I do it for free and I don't offer a personalized request service. I gladly accept suggestions, but I'm not going to implement whatever anyone wants. Like all the addons or tools I program, I want to keep it as simple as possible.
4. It's tested on Steam version and the version downloaded from tib2.com on Windows 11 (24H2). I'm not sure if it can work on Windows 10 or outdated versions of both operating systems (don't ask for older OS or linux).

If you have any problems, **create a GitHub issue**. Try not to talk to me privately :)
